Our team tackled Challenge 02 – FinDocGPT: AI for Financial Document Analysis & Investment Strategy, aiming to streamline how investors and analysts process complex financial data to make informed decisions faster.

The problem we addressed is the time-consuming, fragmented nature of financial analysis—where professionals must parse through raw market data, earnings reports, forecasts, and technical indicators from multiple sources. This process often delays decision-making and increases the risk of missing critical opportunities.

During the hackathon, we built an AI-powered financial assistant that integrates multiple data streams—historical market data, financial statements, macroeconomic indicators—and analyzes them with a combination of Prophet for time-series forecasting, XGBoost for trend classification, and advanced language models for document summarization and strategy recommendations.

The solution delivers:

Automated forecasts with visual components.

Derivative analysis to detect momentum changes.

Natural language insights for quick strategy evaluation.

Direct integration with financial APIs for live data retrieval.

Our primary beneficiaries are retail investors, financial advisors, and analysts who need fast, accurate insights without manually sifting through dozens of reports. Today, our prototype already connects to real financial data, generates predictive analytics, and outputs strategy-ready summaries in seconds.

What’s impressive is how we combined machine learning models, LLM-based analysis, and real-time data fetching into a single, seamless workflow. This significantly reduces research time while increasing clarity and accessibility for decision-makers.

By leveraging AI to bridge the gap between raw financial documents and actionable investment strategies, we believe this solution could transform how market intelligence is gathered and applied.
